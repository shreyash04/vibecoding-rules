# Agent Auto-Run Instructions

## 1. Forbidden Commands
Any attempt to run these will be skipped and logged in `changes.md`:
- rm
- rmdir
- mv
- chmod
- chown
- sudo
- su
- dd
- curl
- wget

## 2. Safe-Alternative Strategy
When a forbidden command is encountered:
1. **Skip** the original command.  
2. **Log** the skip in `changes.md`.  
3. **Choose** one of:
   - A non-destructive alternative (for example, copy with `cp` instead of `mv`, use `rm -i` or move to a `.trash` folder with confirmation).  
4. **Execute** the chosen alternative and record it in `changes.md`.

## 3. How to Version Files
- In case that you are working on a sensitive file, or a file that I have mentioned to preserve the original format of, agent should:
  1. Copy to `filename_v1`, `filename_v2`, etc.  
  2. Apply changes to the newest `.vN` copy.  
- Do not overwrite the original without creating a versioned backup.
- This is only in case of files that I have mentioned should be dealt with carefully.

## 4. Logging Format
All skips and replacements go into `changes.md` in this format:
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC
Original: <command string>
Status: skipped
Alternative: <what was run instead>


Keep `changes.md` up to date so you can review any trapped or swapped operations at a glance.
