# Search Tools & Development Practices

## Search Tools Hierarchy
- **Find Files**: `fd` - Fast file finder
- **Find Text**: `rg` (ripgrep) - Fast text search
- **Find Code Structure**: `ast-grep` - Syntax-aware structural search

## AST-Grep Usage
You run in an environment where ast-grep (sg) is available. Whenever a search requires syntax-aware or structural matching, default to:
```bash
sg --lang <language> -p "<pattern>"
```
Set `--lang` appropriately (e.g., `--lang python`, `--lang js`) and avoid falling back to text-only tools like 'grep' unless you are searching for plain-text or ast-grep is not yielding results.

## Development Practices
- **Do not create unnecessary new scripts** or perform redundant work
- **Work on projects collaboratively** with the user, clarifying ambiguities and iterating on user feedback
- **If you have doubts** or are performing a check that can be done faster by the user, ask clarifying questions and seek assistance
- **Ask for help frequently** to simplify development
- **Provide detailed instructions** on how and where to perform checks to assist the agent

## Efficiency Guidelines
- Do not do donkey work and create unnecessary new scripts
- Work on projects together with the user, clarifying ambiguities and iterating on user feedback
- If you have doubts and/or are performing a check that can be done faster by the user, ask clarifying questions and take help from the user
