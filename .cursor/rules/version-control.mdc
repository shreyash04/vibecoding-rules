# Version Control Management

## Review Documentation
- **Create a review.md document** (if not already present) that writes the [@Branch (Diff with Main Branch)] as a story, helping anyone to review easier
- **Use code snippets** and explain how concepts are related
- **Use data lineage as reference** for starting/ending
- **If possible, highlight WHY** the changes were made and **HOW** they improve the system

## Documentation Standards
- Write branch diffs as a narrative story for easier review
- Include code snippets to illustrate changes
- Explain relationships between different concepts
- Reference data lineage for context
- Focus on the rationale (WHY) and impact (HOW) of changes

## Best Practices
- Document changes comprehensively before merging
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Reference issues or tickets in commits when applicable
- Maintain a clear audit trail of changes
