# Markdown File Editing Guidelines

## Core Principles
- **Take maximum context** from the repository and codebase and understand existing findings
- **Based on your understanding** of the findings, make changes to the file accordingly
- **Make extremely precise edits** to the file while trying not to change or remove anything that already exists
- **Do not add unnecessary new things**
- **Check if the formatting is consistent**. Make it consistent if it is not
- **ONLY CHANGE WHAT IS BEING TOLD TO**
